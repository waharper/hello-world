# hello-world
--Another training repository--

I am interested in JS.

I am currently completing courses at Linkedin on front-end design and development (HTML, CSS, JS).

I will pursue an online program from GNTC in the fall for an AAS in web dev.

I came to Github because Rand-Hendrickson keeps his course files repsository here.

I am moving to Atlanta.  Prayers are appreciated.
